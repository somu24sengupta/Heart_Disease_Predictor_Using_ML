The objectives of the Framingham Study are to study the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors, trends in CVD incidence and its risk factors over time, and familial patterns of CVD and risk factors. Other important objectives include the estimation of incidence rates of disease and description of the natural history of cardiovascular disease, including the sequence of clinical signs and systems that precede the clinically recognizable syndrome and the consequences and course of clinically manifest disease.
**Key Facts:**
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the **leading** cause of **death** globally, taking an estimated **17.9 million** people died from CVDs in **2019**, representing **32%** of all **global deaths. Of these deaths, **85% were due to heart attack and stroke**
*   *More than **four out of five CVD deaths** are due to **heart attacks** and **strokes**, and **one third of these deaths** occur prematurely in people under **70 years of age**.*
*   *The most important behavioural **risk factors** of heart disease and stroke are **unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol**.*
