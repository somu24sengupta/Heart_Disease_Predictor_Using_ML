# Heart_Disease_Predictor_Using_ML
# Project objective & scope
The objectives of the Framingham Study are to study the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors, trends in CVD incidence and its risk factors over time, and familial patterns of CVD and risk factors. Other important objectives include the estimation of incidence rates of disease and description of the natural history of cardiovascular disease, including the sequence of clinical signs and systems that precede the clinically recognizable syndrome and the consequences and course of clinically manifest disease.
**Key Facts:**
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the **leading** cause of **death** globally, taking an estimated **17.9 million** people died from CVDs in **2019**, representing **32%** of all **global deaths. Of these deaths, **85% were due to heart attack and stroke**
*   More than **four out of five CVD deaths** are due to **heart attacks** and **strokes**, and **one third of these deaths** occur prematurely in people under **70 years of age**.*
*   The most important behavioural **risk factors** of heart disease and stroke are **unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol**.*
*   Over **three quarters** of CVD deaths take place in **low- and middle-income countries**

# Data Preprocessing & EDA
Exploratory data analysis or commonly known as EDA helps to explore data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that might cause new data collection and experiments. EDA build a robust understanding of the data, issues associated with either the info or process. it’s a scientific approach to get the story of the data.
It focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing. It also helps while handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed.

# Future Scope of Improvements
The dataset can be trained using more no of different algorithms to get higher accuracy.
Cross-validation can improve the over all train test splitting.
Null values can be determined and replaced by mean median or mode or any other suitable methods.
A larger dataset can be more beneficial for the model training.
